    description: Advanced buffering mode, where the cache uses the fetch pattern to predict highly accessed data and store it in low-energy memory
    value: 1
  - name: MINACTIVITY
    description: Minimum activity mode, which allows the cache to minimize activity in logic that it predicts has a low probability being used. This mode can introduce wait-states into the instruction fetch stream when the cache exits one of its low-activity states. The number of wait-states introduced is small, but users running with 0-wait-state memory and wishing to reduce the variability that the cache might introduce with additional wait-states may wish to lower the cache low-power level. Note, this mode includes the advanced buffering mode functionality.
