enum/SINGLEPRESS:
  bit_size: 1
  variants:
  - name: MULTIPRESS
    description: After KEYIF is set and then cleared, scanning will continue. This can give multiple interrupts for the same key press, but allow multiple key presses to be detected. To use this mode for multi-key detection, the ISR should update a section of memory of COLNUM bytes on each interrupt, until key release is detected. After key release, the section of memory where key presses are recorded can be processed.
    value: 0
  - name: SINGLEPRESS
    description: After KEYIF has been set and cleared, it will not set again until no key press is detected. This allows faster response since the ISR can start processing data as soon as the KEYIF is set.
