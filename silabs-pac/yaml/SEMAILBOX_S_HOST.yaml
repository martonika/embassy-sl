    description: A write access to any address in this area will be mapped to the TX FIFO (only for the payload). A read access to any address in this area will be mapped to the RX FIFO (only for the payload). Using an address range (16 x 32-bit) rather than one single address mapped to the FIFO allows using incremental bursts.
